# Automations
{: .fs-9 }

Using IOS Shortcuts it is possible to configure a number of automations. A automation is a combination of a defined shortcut and then an IOS automation that will trigger that shortcut [based on a IOS supported event](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/apd932ff833f/ios). Both the shortcut itself and the automation are created within the Shortcuts app.

Any shortcut automation will need to invoke the app with a given command - as a text string. The list of commands are described on the [Siri](./siri.md) page.
