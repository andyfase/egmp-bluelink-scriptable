# Multiple Car Support
{: .fs-9 }

Since v1.2.0 the app supports the ability to have multiple cars configured (one per app script) with dedicated configuration per script created within Scriptable. This gives you the ability to have multiple widgets, each a car dedicated to a widget - with one-click access to each car.

## Enabling Multi-Car Support

First setup the [script as normal](./install.md) for your first car. Ensure you specify the correct VIN within the settings for the car you wish to setup, enable the "Multi Car" setting if you have previously used older versions of the app than v1.2.0 - if you hadnt this setting is not needed.

Once setup, within the Scriptable app press and hold the "egmp-bluelink" row and select "Duplicate", this will bring up a code window - just click on "done". This will produce a script likely called "egmp-bluelink 1", feel free to rename to something more appropiate (press and hold and choose rename)
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

Now open the new script, it will prompt for Bluelink settings as per the first install, proceed to configure the same settings but this time select the second car's VIN. Once setup you can configure a new widget for this second car - just ensure when you configure the widget you select the new scriptable script.
