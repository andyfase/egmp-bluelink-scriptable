# Bluelink Scriptable feature set
{: .fs-9 }

The app is designed to perform a subset of the main Hyundai / Kia app, but the subset that makes up for 99% of your normal usage. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }


The app is driven through the main widget, which can sit on either your lockscreen or homescreen - clicking on the widget opens the app automatically, swiping away closes it. The widget automatically updates the data displayed regularly, attempting to balance freshness of data while limiting the amount of remote connections to the car.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

[Multiple widget sizes are available](./widgets.md), data displayed varies based on the size available, but common items include:
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

- Current battery state of charge
- Icons to indicate charging, or charger connected
- If charging, day/time charging will complete and the power level the car is charging at
- Last date/time the car was queried for its current state
{: .fs-4 .fw-300 }

Using the main app and through the [IOS Control Center](./control-center.md) you can:
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

- Lock and Unlock the car
- Pre warm/cool the car or use your own preset climate configurations
- Start and Stop charging of the car
- Change charge limits using your own pre-defined charge limit configurations
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

The app also supports the use of [Siri Shortcuts](./siri.md), allowing you to ask siri to ***"get the status of the car"***, or ***"start warming the car"***. See the Siri Shortcuts section for more info.
